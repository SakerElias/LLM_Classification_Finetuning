# LLM_Classification_Finetuning
This repository contains work for the Machine Learning Project Course, where we apply LLM fine-tuning techniques to solve a text classification problem from a Kaggle competition. The goal is to explore how pretrained transformer-based language models can be adapted for domain-specific classification tasks efficiently.
