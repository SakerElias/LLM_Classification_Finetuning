# LLM_Classification_Finetuning

This repository contains our work for the **Machine Learning Project Course**, where we apply **Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning** techniques to solve a **text classification** problem from a **Kaggle competition**.  

The goal is to explore how pretrained transformer-based language models can be efficiently adapted for domain-specific classification tasks using modern fine-tuning strategies.
